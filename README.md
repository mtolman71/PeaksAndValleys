# PeaksAndValleys
A Simple, Story-based Survival Game

This system is a simple, story-based Survival game. The user will create a character, set their character’s name and type, and then try to survive as long as they are able. The main game loop will present the player with a scenario and then list potential responses to that scenario. Based on the player’s choice, they will either be awarded a set number of points, or die. Upon dying, the player’s points will be saved to the database and they will be returned to the main menu screen.
